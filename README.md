# Astro Starter Kit: Basics

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project bootstrapped with [`create astro`](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

2. Update the .env (if applicable)

First, run the development server:

```bash


# Install deps
npm install

# Run dev server
npm dev
```
````

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory except if used within content

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
