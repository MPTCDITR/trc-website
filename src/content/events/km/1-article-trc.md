O Phnom Penh, 26 November 2020, Minister of Post and
 Telecommunications Vandeth Chea participated in the leadership transfer
 ceremony of Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) held at the
 TRC premises. Present at the ceremony were MPTC leadership, TRC
 leadership and officials.

 Secretary of State Chakrya Moa highlighted some of TRC’s past
 achievements, particularly the modernization of equipment, increasing
 effectiveness of the telecommunications and ICT infrastructure, and crime
 prevention. TRC has also provided capacity building and livelihood support
 programs for officials and employees as a way to promote team spirit.

  Speaking at the ceremony, H.E. Chenda Thong, the newly appointed
 chairman of TRC, expressed gratitude towards the government and Minister
 Chea for placing trust and confidence in his ability to lead TRC. Chairman
 Thong also took the opportunity to commend Secretary Moa for his leadership
 of TRC, bringing about noticeable development of the telecoms sector. Under
 the new administration, Chairman Thong stated his commitment to
 implementing restructuring policies to the highest standards, in line with
 Minister Chea’s steadfast, strategic leadership and government policies in
 advancing the quality and effectiveness of the sector and ensuring fair
 competition among telecoms operators.

  On this occasion, Minister Chea praised Secretary Moa for his past
 contribution to the sector and TRC. However, H.E. Minister stated that there
 remained key and urgent tasks for Chairman Thong to focus on to enforce the
 regulations, license regime management and revenue mobilization.

 In addition, Minister Chea urged Chairman Thong to draft relevant laws and
 regulations to guarantee fair business practice, consumer protection, and
 reliable telecoms services and equipment. H.E. Minister also advised TRC to
 improve their administrative process in carrying out duties, strengthening
 human capital and fostering technical capability.

 In his closing remarks, Minister Chea once again expressed his confidence in
 the leadership and energy of Chairman Thong and thanked MPTC and TRC
 leaderships, officials, and employees for their contribution to TRC’s missions
 and goals as well as to the public good.
