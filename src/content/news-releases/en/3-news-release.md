The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) has found irregularities among mobile network operators, leading to penalties for two main violations:

1. Deactivating active mobile phone numbers and reselling them.
2. Improperly deducting balances from customers' accounts contrary to published tariffs and roaming service terms.

To promote fair competition and protect consumer interests, the TRC encourages consumers to report the following cases:

● Deactivated or resold mobile numbers without the required grace period.
● Unauthorized deductions from mobile phone account balances.
● Subscriptions to plans or services resulting in balance deductions without prior consent.
● Lack of resolution of complaints from mobile network operators.

For more details, please refer to the TRC's official announcement.
