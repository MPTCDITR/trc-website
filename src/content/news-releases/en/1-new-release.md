The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications would like to inform the
 public that, in order to provide convenience to all mobile services users, the
 Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia has required all mobile network
 operators across the country to prepare common codes with standards
 according to the national telecommunications code. The codes and their
 functions are provided in detail as follows:

 (1) *1200# To terminate any unwanted value-added services (VAS)

 (2) *1201# To check the balance

 (3) *1202# To check the user identity
 
 (4) *1203*PIN# To top-up
 
 (5) 1204 To contact customer service
 
 The public may use the five common codes above across all mobile networks,
 free-of-charge, to terminate any unwanted value-added services, check credit
 balance, check user identity, top-up, or contact the customer service of each
 mobile network operator, starting 1 January 2022. For additional information,
 please contact the TRC hotline at 6789 during business hours.
