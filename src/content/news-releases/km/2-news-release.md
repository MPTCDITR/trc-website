The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia has revealed that an unlicensed company, Starlink, has been providing internet services and importing illegal and distributing internet service equipment, which potentially disrupts the quality of telecommunications services and public safety.

As a preventive measure, the TRC has urged users not to install or use internet service equipment of unclear origin and internet services provided by companies that did not acquire license from the TRC. Users can access a list of licensed telecommunication operators available on the TRCâ€™s official website: www.trc.gov.kh.

The TRC also reminds companies to apply for a license before offering internet services in Cambodia and to get approval for importing or distributing telecom equipment. Failure to comply will result in penalties under the Law on Telecommunications.

The TRC has also urged the public to report any cases of illegal sale,distribution, installation, or use of telecommunications equipment and services to the TRC via a hotline or email.
