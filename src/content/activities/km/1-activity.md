Phnom Penh, 26 November 2020, Minister of Post and
Telecommunications Vandeth Chea participated in the leadership transfer
ceremony of Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) held at the
TRC premises. Present at the ceremony were MPTC leadership, TRC
leadership and officials.

Secretary of State Chakrya Moa highlighted some of TRC’s past
achievements, particularly the modernization of equipment, increasing
effectiveness of the telecommunications and ICT infrastructure, and crime
prevention. TRC has also provided capacity building and livelihood support
programs for officials and employees as a way to promote team spirit.

Speaking at the ceremony, H.E. Chenda Thong, the newly appointed
chairman of TRC, expressed gratitude towards the government and Minister
Chea for placing trust and confidence in his ability to lead TRC. Chairman
Thong also took the opportunity to commend Secretary Moa for his leadership
of TRC, bringing about noticeable development of the telecoms sector. Under
the new administration, Chairman Thong stated his commitment to
implementing restructuring policies to the highest standards, in line with
Minister Chea’s steadfast, strategic leadership and government policies in
advancing the quality and effectiveness of the sector and ensuring fair
competition among telecoms operators.

On this occasion, Minister Chea praised Secretary Moa for his past
contribution to the sector and TRC. However, H.E. Minister stated that there remained key and urgent tasks for Chairman Thong to focus on to enforce the
regulations, license regime management and revenue mobilization.

In addition, Minister Chea urged Chairman Thong to draft relevant laws and
regulations to guarantee fair business practice, consumer protection, and
reliable telecoms services and equipment. H.E. Minister also advised TRC to
improve their administrative process in carrying out duties, strengthening
human capital and fostering technical capability.

In his closing remarks, Minister Chea once again expressed his confidence in the leadership and energy of Chairman Thong and thanked MPTC and TRC
leaderships, officials, and employees for their contribution to TRC’s missions and goals as well as to the public good.
