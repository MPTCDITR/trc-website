Scams often cross borders, which makes international collaboration essential in tackling them effectively. We’re proud to announce the signing of a new MOU with the Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) to strengthen cooperation in tackling phone scams across the region.

Why it matters:

● Regional Collaboration: TRC is a vital partner in mitigating scam-related activities in Southeast Asia

● Knowledge Exchange: Both authorities will enhance the exchange of technical expertise and insights into scam traffic trends

● Data Sharing: Facilitating the identification of telecom operators contributing to scam calls, enabling faster action and improved scam prevention

The new MOU marks a key step in combating phone scams, with a focus on the mutual exchange of information, and regulatory cooperation to develop robust anti-scam initiatives.
