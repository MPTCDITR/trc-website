On May 31, 2023, the Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC)
and the Securities Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) organized a
collaborative Capacity Building Training on "Cybersecurity”. The training
aimed to equip officials from regulatory bodies and relevant stakeholders with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively respond to cyber risks arising from the use of technology.

During the Capacity Building Training, participants had the opportunity to
engage in interactive sessions with speakers on emerging cyber threats,
incident response strategies, and the importance of robust cybersecurity
frameworks.

The TRC and SERC remain steadfast in their commitment to promoting
cybersecurity awareness and resilience in Cambodia's telecommunications
and securities sectors. By organizing such capacity-building initiatives and knowledge-sharing platforms, we aim to facilitate a safe and secure digital environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, and supports sustainable economic growth.
