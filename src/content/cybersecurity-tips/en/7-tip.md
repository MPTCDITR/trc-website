## 1. General Information

The cyber security policy is to provide strategic guidance on how to protect their organization's systems and data from cyber security threats. These cyber security principles are set out in four main activities:

Management mechanisms: Identification and management of safety risks.
Prevention mechanisms: Implement risk management.
Monitoring Mechanism: Monitoring and understanding of cyber security events to identify cyber security incidents.
Response mechanism: Response and recovery from cyber security incidents.

## 2. Principles of management mechanisms

Principles of management mechanism:

1. The cyber security chief must be a leader and have an understanding of cyber security.
2. Identities and values, systems, programs and data are defined and documented.
3. The system requires confidentiality, integrity and accessibility, and applications and data are defined and documented.
4. The organizational risk management framework must include a security risk management process.
5. Security risks must be identified, documented, managed and accepted prior to both being authorized and used.

## 3. Principles of protection mechanisms

The principles of the defense mechanism are:

1. Systems and software must be designed, deployed, maintained and shut down in accordance with the values ​​and principles of confidentiality, integrity and feasibility.
2. The transmission and support of various systems and applications, suppliers must have a clear source.
3. Design and configuration must minimize the number of system and software attacks.
4. Systems and programs must be securely managed and accountable.
5. Security vulnerabilities in systems and applications must be identified and minimized in a timely manner.
6. Trust and support only the operating system, software and computer code executed on the system.
7. Data is encrypted during management and when passing between different systems.
8. Communication data between different systems is managed and controllable.
9. Application and configuration data is backed up securely and regularly.
10. Only trusted employees are granted access to software systems and databases.
11. Employees are given a degree of access to the software systems and databases needed for their tasks.
12. Use a variety of methods to identify and verify employees to software systems and databases.
13. Staff are provided with cyber security awareness training.
14. Personal access to the system, infrastructure and facilities are restricted to authorized personal staff.

## 4. Principles of control mechanisms

The principles of the control mechanism are:

1. Event logs must be collected and analyzed to find cyber security events.
2. Cyber ​​security events must be analyzed promptly and in a timely manner to identify cyber security incidents.

## 5. Principles of response mechanisms

The principles of the response mechanism are:

1. Cyber ​​security incidents must be reported both internally and externally to the relevant institutions in a timely manner.
2. Cyber ​​security incidents must be prevented, eliminated and restored in a timely manner.
3. Business renewals and disaster relief plans are approved immediately when necessary.

## 6. Cyber ​​Security Model

When implementing an organization's cyber security policy, it can be used in accordance with the cyber security model to evaluate the implementation of individual policies, the implementation of group policies, or the entire cyber security policy.

The five levels in the Cyber ​​Security model are:

1. Incomplete model: Cyber ​​security principles are applied in part or not at all.
2. Beginning model: Cyber ​​security principles are applied, but in a negative or functional manner.
3. Development model: Cyber ​​security principles are adequately implemented but project-based.
4. Management Model: Cyber ​​security principles are established as a standard of business practice and are strictly enforced for the entire organization.
5. Efficiency model: Focus on continuous optimization and adjustment for the implementation of cyber security principles throughout the organization.
