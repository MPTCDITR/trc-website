Nowadays, more and more connections are due to the internet. Although things are easier, it also means that our personal lives and financial information are more vulnerable to identity theft. When we talk about identity theft, protection is the key. So here are five things you should consider:

## 1. How to steal identity

Trash Search: Search the Trash, find copies or discarded files that contain the victim's confidential information, which may allow access to the victim's account.
Robbery: Stealing identities and documents issued by the government to open an account in the victim's name.
Phishing: The use of infected emails to search personal and financial information on victims' computers and devices.
Telephone scams: Persuading victims to provide their personal or financial information over the phone.
Database: Access to private data of customers at stores, health care outlets and credit card companies.

## 2. Be careful what you share online

Social media accounts with low privacy settings can be vulnerable to identity theft. Cybercriminals can search for your name, address, date of birth or phone number and use this information to open an account or sign up for a driver's license.

When you use a public Wi-Fi connection, you will leave digital footprints. Be careful of the information you send and receive by always verifying that the website address matches the name in the address bar, and consider using a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi.

## 3. Help protect children and the elderly

Criminals can steal children's identities because parents neglect to check their children's credit history. IT thieves can steal children's identities years before they become adults, gaining access to their bank accounts on their own. To help protect a child’s identity, parents can request a copy of their child’s bank account statement each year and look for any suspicious activity. The elderly can also be a target for scammers as they are less careful with their personal information. They may not be accustomed to living with the Internet, so they may not be aware of the protection of their online identity.

## 4. Vulnerability reduction methods

Destroy personal documents such as bank statements and credit cards before disposal.
Online should consider what you share and delete location information from photos.
Use passwords that are unique and difficult to guess using alphanumeric symbols.
Check all your financial accounts weekly, reporting any differences as soon as possible.

## 5. Identity theft and data leakage

Although consumer caution is important, it is not enough. In fact, the recent Equifax data leak revealed the personal information of more than 147.9 million people. Therefore, it is a good idea to use anti-theft services as these services can notify you if suspicious activity is identified in your network or if a new account is opened using your ID number. Some of the most popular identity protection services include Aura All-in-One ID Theft Protection, IdentityForce, Norton LifeLock, McAfee ID Theft Protection, and IDShield. Alternatively, you can check the presence of your email or phone number through HaveIBeenPwned.com to find out if your email or phone history has been leaked.
