## 1. General Information

Suppose an employee asks a family member to use a laptop from his or her workplace, thinking that just a little use might not be a big deal, but he or she is unaware that a family member has accidentally downloaded a virus to his or her laptop. When employees take their laptops back to work, the virus can infect the organization's system. This negligence causes damage to critical infrastructure and leaks of institutional confidential data.

This is not just an imaginary case, the World Economic Forum has found that 95% of all cyber security incidents are caused by negligence on the part of employees. Although the institution is equipped with modern protection systems and good practices, the negligence and unintentional mistakes of employees can lead to serious cyber security incidents. According to IBM, the data leak in 2023 caused $ 4.45 million in damage, an increase of 15% over the previous three years.

Top 5 Most Neglected Employee Mistakes:

### 1. Let others use the institution's tools without permission

Allowing friends or family members to use the institution's tools at home does not seem like a big deal, but they can accidentally discover the organization's confidential data or inadvertently access unsecured websites and applications. If unauthorized users make the device infected, cybercriminals can gain access to institutional data or cloud applications, which can lead to serious security risks, including data leaks, intellectual property theft and reputation damage.

These risk mitigation measures include implementing strict security controls, such as the use of passwords and multi-factor authentication, and educating employees on the importance of keeping institutional devices unauthorized.

### 2. Transmitting confidential information to the wrong target

Suppose an employee sends an e-mail containing confidential information to the person in charge, leading to a leak. In areas where e-mail messages contain sensitive data, such as healthcare, sending sensitive data to the wrong recipient can have serious consequences.

To reduce such negligence, there are ways such as encrypting e-mails with confidential information, using the notification function to verify the target address again before sending e-mails, and using data loss prevention mechanisms.

### 3. Reusing old words or phrases

Institutions may have effective password policies, but if employees re-use old passwords on personal devices, websites and less secure applications, they will still provide opportunities for cybercriminals, as old passwords may be present in Large leaked passwords available on dark websites.

Although there is no good way to completely prevent employees from re-using old passwords, authentication and protection measures can help inform if a password is leaked on a dark website.

### 4. Exposure of remote system access

Working remotely also brings new challenges. IT teams often have to perform remote management tasks, but revealing the access to the system on the Internet is tantamount to revealing the gateway of the infrastructure. Institution to anyone who uses the internet.

To access the system remotely without revealing the organization's entrance, you should choose to put only the most necessary services on the Internet, in addition, the use of automated maintenance means will help you reduce vulnerabilities and risks.

### 5. Misuse of high privileged accounts

IT managers can use their high-privileged account to perform their daily tasks without the need for high-level access because it is easy and they do not need to switch back and forth between management accounts. And normal user accounts, but this convenience leads to a high risk, if their management account is hacked, it can cause serious damage.

Therefore, the distinction between a highly authorized management account and a regular user account is crucial. Institutions should apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring that employees have access to only the resources they need to perform their functions. Institutions should also regularly monitor and audit employees' access rights, removing unnecessary rights as soon as possible.

## 2. Cyber ​​security is teamwork

Cyber ​​security is a team effort, no matter how strong the technical protection mechanism of the organization, the human resources in the organization is the first line of defense and the weakest point in the organization. By understanding the most common negligence and flexible policy implementation and capacity building, institutions can transform human resources from weak to valuable protectors in the fight against cyber threats. . In addition to cyber security, institutional protection is better than cure.
